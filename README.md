- âš¡ **Fun fact**:  
  Besides coding, Iâ€™m a huge fan of board games, video games, and football. I played guitar between the ages of 12 and 17, and I've been hitting the gym consistently since I turned 18 â€“ proud gym enthusiast.

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning**:  
  I maintain studies in the Angular framework, Microfrontends, and the Quarkus framework. I seek to learn about container systems such as Docker and Kubernetes (k8s), but my main focus remains on frontend technologies.
